	abstract = {All computers process information electronically. A processing method based on magnetism is reported here, in which networks of interacting submicrometer magnetic dots are used to perform logic operations and propagate information at room temperature. The logic states are signaled by the magnetization direction of the single-domain magnetic dots; the dots couple to their nearest neighbors through magnetostatic interactions. Magnetic solitons carry information through the networks, and an applied oscillating magnetic field feeds energy into the system and serves as a clock. These networks offer a several thousandfold increase in integration density and a hundredfold reduction in power dissipation over current microelectronic technology.},

    abstract={Energy efficient nanomagnetic logic (NML) computing architectures propagate binary information by relying on dipolar field coupling to reorient closely spaced nanoscale magnets. Signal propagation in nanomagnet chains has been previously characterized by static magnetic imaging experiments; however, the mechanisms that determine the final state and their reproducibility over millions of cycles in high-speed operation have yet to be experimentally investigated. Here we present a study of NML operation in a high-speed regime. We perform direct imaging of digital signal propagation in permalloy nanomagnet chains with varying degrees of shape-engineered biaxial anisotropy using full-field magnetic X-ray transmission microscopy and time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy after applying nanosecond magnetic field pulses. An intrinsic switching time of 100{\thinspace}ps per magnet is observed. These experiments, and accompanying macrospin and micromagnetic simulations, reveal the underlying physics of NML architectures repetitively operated on nanosecond timescales and identify relevant engineering parameters to optimize performance and reliability.},

    abstract = "Feature sizes in chip manufacturing are becoming so small that quantum mechanical behavior will soon have a deleterious effect on the function of devices. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QDCA) have been proposed as computing devices which are helped, rather than hindered, by the quantum behavior of electrons. QDCA compute by relaxing to a configuration of minimal energy. Previously, it has been shown that a quantum-dot device may not compute properly if all of its relaxed configurations are not equal in energy level. Such an automation is termed unbalanced. A necessary condition for an automaton to be balanced is that the number of distinguished configurations with minimum energy should equal the number of input combinations the automaton handles. Does an efficient algorithm for determining the number of distinguished ground states exist? If so, it will be difficult to find, as such an algorithm is shown to be NP-hard. Furthermore, the related problem of determining the minimum energy level of arbitrary automata is also shown to be NP-hard. These results have important implications for simulating and analyzing QDCA on conventional computers."
