\section{Introduction}
This thesis makes use of the \mumax{} micromagnetic simulation tool~\cite{MuMax3}.
Gilbert is \cite{Gilbert1956} and Lifdau is \cite{LANDAU1992}.

Interesting sources regarding the random thermal switching could be \cite{ThermFluc_SingleDomain, RandomSwitch_MonteCarlo, Nonmonotonic_reversal}, and perhaps \cite{MagDynamics_JumpNoise}.
Exchange bias is explained in \cite{ExchangeBias, ExchangeBias_nanostructures, ExchangeBias_Mechanisms}.
Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) are discussed in \cite{QCA_Algorithms, QCA_ImageRecognition, QCA_GameOfLife}. Magnetic QCA (MQCA) are discussed in \cite{MQCA_MajorityGate, MQCA_RoomTemp}.

\section{Physics}
% === THE FOLLOWING IS A NONCOMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICS ===
The main formulae are derived in \cite{abert2013discrete} or \cite{NML_Carlton} and in the \mumax{} advances \cite{MuMax3_advances}.
\subsection{Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation}
The Landau-Lifschitz(-Gilbert) equation is a partial differential equation given by
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \vb{m}}{\partial t} = - \gamma_0 \vb{m} \cross \vb{H_{eff}} - \lambda \vb{m} \cross (\vb{m} \cross \vb{H_{eff}}) \mathrm{.}
\end{equation}
PDE requires an effective field $\vb{H_{eff}}$ which is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\vb{H_{eff}} = - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial E}{\partial \vb{M}}
\end{equation}
the energy $E$ is the sum of several contributions, all explained in the next section.

Gilbert \cite{Gilbert1956} replaced the damping term with a term dependent on the time derivative of the magnetization:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \vb{m}}{\partial t} = - \gamma_0 \Big( \vb{m} \cross \vb{H_{eff}} - \lambda \vb{m} \cross (\vb{m} \cross \vb{H_{eff}}) \Big) \mathrm{.}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Energy contributions}
\subsubsection{Exchange energy}
Tries to align neighboring spins:
$E_{i,j} = -J \vb{S_i} \vdot \vb{S_j}$
\subsubsection{Magnetostatic energy/Demagnetization energy}
I think:
\begin{align}
	\div{\vb{B}} &= 0 \\
	\vb{B} &= \mu_0 (\vb{H} + \vb{M})
\end{align}
means that a given $\vb{M}$ must result in a certain $\vb{H}$, which is then called $\vb{H}_{demag}$.
($\vb{H}$ is gradient of scalar field $u$)

\subsubsection{Anisotropy energy}
Only even orders in Taylor expansion are considered, in order to fulfill $E(\vb{m}_{min}) = E(-\vb{m}_{min})$. Then $K_{u1}, K_{u2}, \dots$ for order 2, 4, ... respectively.

There is uniaxial, and there is cubic, and there is many other options which are rarely used.

\subsubsection{Zeeman energy}
Energy of magnetization in an external field.
$E = -\mu_0 \vb{M} \cdot \vb{H_{ext}}$

\section{Tests}
\subsection{Random thermal switching}
\subsubsection{Preparation}
\textbf{Step 1: find energy barrier} \\
The procedure used is to set both $m$ and $B_{ext}$ at a certain angle and then \code{minimize()}. Both the magnetic field $B_{ext}$ and the angle $\theta$ are then varied, with $B_{ext}$ going from very high to very low values, and $\theta=0\dots\pi/2$ in steps of $\pi/4$. One could increase the amount of $\theta$-steps, but it is observed that an angle of $\pi/4$ remains magnetized at that angle regardless of the external field, at the very least until $B_{ext} = \SI{0.00153}{\tesla}$. It is however an unstable equilibrium and any slight deviation from this angle will quickly relax to either \SI{0}{\degree} or \SI{90}{\degree} at low fields.
One could even omit the part where theta goes from $\pi/4$ to $\pi/2$ due to symmetry reasons.
All of $\theta = k\frac{\pi}{4} , k\in\mathbb{Z}$ are stable.
At high fields everything is stable and just uniform, which makes the energy landscape flat.

\textbf{Step 2: random switching over \SI{100}{\nano\second}} \\
In GYP-18~\cite{GYP-18} the formula
\begin{equation}
    t_i = -\frac{1}{f_0} \exp(\frac{\Delta E_i}{k_B T}) \ln(1-P_i)
\end{equation}
appears, with $f_0 = \SI{e12}{\hertz}$ attempt frequency, and $P_i$ random between 0 and 1. The average value of $-\ln(1-P_i)$ is then $\ln(4) \approx 1.4$.

To get an average $t_i = \SI{100}{\nano\second}$ at $T=\SI{300}{\kelvin}$, one should therefore have
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E_i = k_B T \ln(\frac{f_0 t_i}{\ln(4)}) = 11.19 k_B T = \SI{0.310}{\electronvolt} \mathrm{.}
\end{equation}
The barrier height of a \SI{65}{\nano\metre} elliptic plus-sign geometry is \SI{0.346}{\nano\metre}.
Idea: perhaps attempt frequency is the sinusoidal pattern in the long simulations, with period of about \SI{0.5}{\nano\second}. Observation: This worked with the previous method where $B_{ext}$ was not varied, but with the new (correct) method the $f_0 = \SI{e12}{\hertz}$ works very well again.
Also there is another formula in mumax3~\cite{MuMax3}

Observation: with a barrier height approximately equal to $\SI{0.346}{\electronvolt}$, a switching speed of about \SI{100}{\nano\second} is observed.

Question: should $\alpha$ be 0.1 always, i guess this is just a case of ``0.1 works so we use 0.1''
Answer: it's better to use 0.01

\subsubsection{Results}
Step 1: find energy barrier \\
With perfectly circular geometry (i.e. \\
\code{geometry := Ellipse(100e-9, 100e-9)} \\
\code{geometry = geometry.Add(Ellipse(100e-9, 100e-9).RotZ(Pi/2))}) \\
there is still shape anisotropy, but with opposite sign (what are maxima in actual plus-figures are now minima)

Findings (for \SI{100}{\nano\metre} long axis ellipse plus-sign):
at \SI{45}{\nano\metre} the preferred directions switch from the axes (\SI{0}{\degree}) to in between the axes (\SI{45}{\degree}),
at \SI{65}{\nano\metre} the anisotropy with preferred \SI{0}{\degree} direction is the strongest

After running for \SI{1}{\micro\second} at \SI{300}{\kelvin}, with shape \SI{65}{\nano\metre} by \SI{100}{\nano\metre} ellipses in plus shape, the following angles were observed (\cref{fig:biaxial_island:1microsecond_300K_alpha0.1}):
