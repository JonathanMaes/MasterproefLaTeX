It has become a standard tool for both the exploration of new systems and for the interpretation of experimental data. In the last five years, the capabilities of micromagnetic modeling have dramatically increased due to the deployment of graphical processing units (GPU), which have sped up calculations to a factor of 200. This has enabled many studies which were previously unfeasible. In this topical review, we give an overview of this modeling approach and show how it has contributed to the forefront of current magnetism research.}

    This chapter examines the distribution of magnetic moments in a ferromagnetic crystal. When the crystal is magnetized, the boundaries between the oppositely magnetized layers move so that the layers with one direction of magnetic moment grow at the cost of the layers with moments in the opposite direction. The presence of separate elementary regions, magnetized in opposite directions, is due only to the demagnetizing effect of the surface, and the number and dimensions of these regions are entirely determined by the dimensions of the body. The analysis of the preceding section gives only the distribution of the directions of the magnetic moments in the intermediate regions but gives nothing for determining the width of the layers. If the crystal is placed in an external magnetic field, which is directed parallel to the axis of easiest magnetization, the boundaries between the layers begin to move so that the layers with magnetic moments parallel to the field become wider."

requirements for the control and design of specific magnetic properties.
The exchange bias effect in ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers appears
to be a useful feature for controlling one of the most important
characteristics of a ferromagnet: coercivity.  Prospects for control and
enhancement of desirable effects depend upon a clear understanding of
mechanisms governing exchange bias.  The processes underlying the
existence and properties of exchange bias are reviewed, with particular
emphasis on the roles of interface structure and temperature.  Results
from numerical simulations are used to illustrate how exchange bias is
modified by geometric structures at the interface and randomly placed
defects. A general theoretical formulation of the bias problem is
proposed, and an expression for the interface energy is derived.  A key
result is the existence of higher-order coupling terms when more than one
sublattice of the antiferromagnet is present at the interface. Results
from calculations of finite temperature effects on bias and coercivity are
described, and the concept of viscosity in the antiferromagnet is
discussed.  A brief discussion is also included of how a dynamic linear
response, such as ferromagnetic resonance or light scattering, can be used
to determine relevant anisotropy and exchange parameters.}

    abstract = "Feature sizes in chip manufacturing are becoming so small that quantum mechanical behavior will soon have a deleterious effect on the function of devices. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QDCA) have been proposed as computing devices which are helped, rather than hindered, by the quantum behavior of electrons. QDCA compute by relaxing to a configuration of minimal energy. Previously, it has been shown that a quantum-dot device may not compute properly if all of its relaxed configurations are not equal in energy level. Such an automation is termed unbalanced. A necessary condition for an automaton to be balanced is that the number of distinguished configurations with minimum energy should equal the number of input combinations the automaton handles. Does an efficient algorithm for determining the number of distinguished ground states exist? If so, it will be difficult to find, as such an algorithm is shown to be NP-hard. Furthermore, the related problem of determining the minimum energy level of arbitrary automata is also shown to be NP-hard. These results have important implications for simulating and analyzing QDCA on conventional computers."

  abstract={The magnetostatic exchange length is an important parameter in magnetics as it measures the relative strength of exchange and self-magnetostatic energies. Its use can be found in areas of magnetics including micromagnetics, soft and hard magnetic materials, and information storage. The exchange length is of primary importance because it governs the width of the transition between magnetic domains. Unfortunately, there is some confusion in the literature between the magnetostatic exchange length and a similar distance concerning magnetization reversal mechanisms in particles known as the characteristic length. This confusion is aggravated by the common usage of two different systems of units, SI and cgs. This paper attempts to clarify the situation and recommends equations in both systems of units.},

abstract={Energy efficient nanomagnetic logic (NML) computing architectures propagate binary information by relying on dipolar field coupling to reorient closely spaced nanoscale magnets. Signal propagation in nanomagnet chains has been previously characterized by static magnetic imaging experiments; however, the mechanisms that determine the final state and their reproducibility over millions of cycles in high-speed operation have yet to be experimentally investigated. Here we present a study of NML operation in a high-speed regime. We perform direct imaging of digital signal propagation in permalloy nanomagnet chains with varying degrees of shape-engineered biaxial anisotropy using full-field magnetic X-ray transmission microscopy and time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy after applying nanosecond magnetic field pulses. An intrinsic switching time of 100{\thinspace}ps per magnet is observed. These experiments, and accompanying macrospin and micromagnetic simulations, reveal the underlying physics of NML architectures repetitively operated on nanosecond timescales and identify relevant engineering parameters to optimize performance and reliability.},
